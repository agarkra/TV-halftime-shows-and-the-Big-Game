# TV-halftime-shows-and-the-Big-Game
Data Camp Data Visualisation project on the analysis of TV, super bowls and halftime musicians data.
 In this notebook we have taken TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game 
 
 The dataset we'll use was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
